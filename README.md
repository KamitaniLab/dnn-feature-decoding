# DNN Feature Decoding from Brain Activities

This repository provides scripts of deep neural network (DNN) feature decoding from fMRI brain activities, originally proposed by [Horikawa & Kamitani (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15037) and employed in DNN-based image reconstruction methods of [Shen et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006633) as well as recent studies in Kamitani lab.
